Where to we want to start?

rough ideas for classes

Game -> Keeps track of game state (start, number of moves, winner?)
Board -> Keeps track of board state
    Line -> Keeps track of discs within board.
            #report with no args
                checks for a slice of length 4, with all matching discs
            #report with args(pos)
                returns the disc in pos
Output -> Displays the board + tokens onto the screen
Player -> Specifies which token for each player

2 players
- PLAYERs take it in turns to drop a colored disc into the top of the play BOARD
- The disc slides to the lowest point within the LINE
- A PLAYER will win the game if 4 discs are in a line (hori, vert, diag), with no interruptions from the other players

To check for a winner ->
- There is a maximum of 42 moves (only 42 positions on the board)
- Do not check before turn 4 (there cannot be a winner as this point)
- There are 69 possible winning 4 in row positions. Do we just hardcode the values?
    = NO- make a loop to check each orientation. hori, vert, diag
    = if values_at(x,x,x,x) are the same && not nil, that player wins
